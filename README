The ABOOK-System
----------------

Installation:
  - Create a Config-directory:
    # mkdir /etc/abook
    # cd /etc/abook/
    # ln -s /path/to/audiobook/folder abdir
  - Create a file with the remote-hosts (see below)
    # vi /etc/abook/remotehosts
  - Enable the followsymlinks-option in your apache-config
  - This folder has to be placed in the http-root folder
  - Make the sub-folders ext and templates/compiled writeable by the webserver:
    # chmod 777 ./ext ./templates/compiled
  - use this to auto-remove old export-tars as an hourly cronjob:
    # cd /var/www/abook/exp ; ls | while read line ; do [ `stat -c %Y $line` -lt `echo "$(date +%s) - 21600" | bc` ] && rm $line ; done > /dev/null 2>&1
  - copy scripts/abtools-autocomplete to /etc/bash_completion.d/
